                        Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. 
                        Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular 
                        and powerful JavaScript server platform

                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for 
                        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
                        and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br><br>
                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
                        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes 
                        the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues 
                        for the appearance of the document.

                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
                        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
                        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br><br>
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, 
                        colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
                        flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable 
                        multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css 
                        file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the 
                        .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share 
                        the file and its formatting.

                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                        JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, 
                        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br><br>
                        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                        Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party 
                        libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

                    <h2>React JS</h2>
                    <p>
                        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library
                         for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of 
                         individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of 
                         single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and 
                         rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional 
                         libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

                    <h2>Node JS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the 
                        V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript 
                        to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce 
                        dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js 
                        represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single 
                        programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
